title: Codex Local
summary: OpenAI Codex local adapter setup and configuration
---

The `codex_local` adapter runs OpenAI's Codex CLI locally. It supports session persistence via `previous_response_id` chaining and skills injection through the global Codex skills directory.

## Prerequisites

- Codex CLI installed (`codex` command available)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in the environment or agent config

## Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `cwd` | string | Yes | Working directory for the agent process (absolute path; created automatically if missing when permissions allow) |
| `model` | string | No | Model to use |
| `promptTemplate` | string | No | Prompt used for all runs |
| `env` | object | No | Environment variables (supports secret refs) |
| `timeoutSec` | number | No | Process timeout (0 = no timeout) |
| `graceSec` | number | No | Grace period before force-kill |
| `dangerouslyBypassApprovalsAndSandbox` | boolean | No | Skip safety checks (dev only) |

## Session Persistence

Codex uses `previous_response_id` for session continuity. The adapter serializes and restores this across heartbeats, allowing the agent to maintain conversation context.

## Skills Injection

The adapter symlinks Paperclip skills into the global Codex skills directory (`~/.codex/skills`). Existing user skills are not overwritten.

When Paperclip is running inside a managed worktree instance (`PAPERCLIP_IN_WORKTREE=true`), the adapter instead uses a worktree-isolated `CODEX_HOME` under the Paperclip instance so Codex skills, sessions, logs, and other runtime state do not leak across checkouts. It seeds that isolated home from the user's main Codex home for shared auth/config continuity.

For manual local CLI usage outside heartbeat runs (for example running as `codexcoder` directly), use:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai agent local-cli codexcoder --company-id <company-id>
```

This installs any missing skills, creates an agent API key, and prints shell exports to run as that agent.

## Environment Test

The environment test checks:

- Codex CLI is installed and accessible
- Working directory is absolute and available (auto-created if missing and permitted)
- Authentication signal (`OPENAI_API_KEY` presence)
- A live hello probe (`codex exec --json -` with prompt `Respond with hello.`) to verify the CLI can actually run

## Authentication Health and Re-login Runbook

Use this when `codex_local` fails with `401 Unauthorized` (including `auth error code: account_deactivated`).

1. Check current auth state:
   - `codex auth status`
2. Re-authenticate if needed:
   - `codex auth login`
3. If using API-key mode, verify key validity:
   - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to a valid key in agent config or environment
4. Re-run one heartbeat and confirm there are no `401 Unauthorized` or `turn.failed` events in the run log.

Paperclip heartbeat guard behavior:

- `codex_local` 401 auth failures are normalized to `codex_auth_401*` error codes.
- When such a failure happens on an issue run, Paperclip automatically sets the issue to `blocked` and posts a standard comment with a reason code (`CODEX_AUTH_401*`) and recovery steps.
