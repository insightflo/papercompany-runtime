# Developing

This project can run fully in local dev without setting up PostgreSQL manually.

## Repo Content Policy

This repository follows the same repo-as-distribution model as upstream Paperclip: the GitHub repository itself is the shipped unit. The product and docs are now papercompany, while low-level CLI/package/env names such as `paperclipai`, `@paperclipai/*`, `PAPERCLIP_*`, and `~/.paperclip` remain compatibility interfaces inherited from Paperclip.

Use `.gitignore` only for local-only state, generated artifacts, caches, logs, and machine-specific outputs.

| Bucket | What belongs here | Examples / notes |
|---|---|---|
| Track in repo / included in GitHub distribution | Source and repository metadata that should ship with the repo | `.github/`, application code, package manifests, CI, release automation, checked-in docs |
| Track in repo but not required at runtime | Guidance and standards that shape contributors, not the running app | `doc/` |
| Local-only / always ignore | Developer machine state and generated outputs | workspace-root `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/worktrees/`, `.claude/memory/`, `.claude/memento/`, `.mintlify/`, `.paperclip-worktrees/`, `data/`, logs, coverage, build output, temp files |
| Case-by-case / policy decision needed | Mixed directories that can contain both tracked instructions and local state | workspace-root `.claude/` and `.sisyphus/` remain shared across `papercompany-runtime/` and `papercompany-artifacts/`. Track intentional shared instruction content there, ignore only the local/generated subpaths listed above. |

Rule of thumb: if a file helps everyone who clones the repo, track it. If it is only useful on one machine or can be regenerated, ignore it.

In the split workspace layout, project-process artifacts such as `TASKS.md`, `management/`, `doc/plans/`, `doc/CLIPHUB.md`, `design/system/`, and `database/standards.md` live in the sibling repo at `../papercompany-artifacts/`.

## Deployment Modes

For mode definitions and intended CLI behavior, see `doc/DEPLOYMENT-MODES.md`.

Current implementation status:

- canonical model: `local_trusted` and `authenticated` (with `private/public` exposure)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24.x. The local dev runtime is pinned to Node 24 because the server depends on the native `re2` module, which is compiled against the active Node ABI.
- pnpm 9+

Use the repo-pinned Node before installing dependencies:

```sh
nvm use
pnpm install
```

The repo-level `pnpm dev` and `pnpm paperclipai ...` scripts automatically
re-exec with the version pinned in `.node-version` / `.nvmrc` when that Node is
available under `nvm`. Set `PAPERCLIP_NODE_BIN=/path/to/node` if your Node 24
binary lives elsewhere.

If Node was changed after dependencies were installed, rebuild `re2` under the active Node:

```sh
npm run rebuild --prefix node_modules/.pnpm/re2@1.24.0/node_modules/re2
```

## Dependency Lockfile Policy

GitHub Actions owns `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

- Do not commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` in pull requests.
- Pull request CI validates dependency resolution when manifests change.
- Pushes to `master` regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml` with `pnpm install --lockfile-only --no-frozen-lockfile`, commit it back if needed, and then run verification with `--frozen-lockfile`.

## Start Dev

From repo root:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts:

- API server: `http://localhost:3200`
- UI: served by the API server in dev middleware mode (same origin as API)

`pnpm dev` runs the server in watch mode and restarts on changes from workspace packages (including adapter packages). Use `pnpm dev:once` to run without file watching.

`pnpm dev:once` now tracks backend-relevant file changes and pending migrations. When the current boot is stale, the board UI shows a `Restart required` banner. You can also enable guarded auto-restart in `Instance Settings > Experimental`, which waits for queued/running local agent runs to finish before restarting the dev server.

Dev runner diagnostics are written to repo-local `.paperclip/` by default:

- `.paperclip/dev-runner-events.ndjson` records structured lifecycle events such as runner start, server child spawn/exit, shutdown signals, health probe transitions, and nearby Node crash reports.
- `.paperclip/dev-runner-child.log` tees the child `@paperclipai/server` stdout/stderr stream so terminal output survives after a crash or shell restart.

Set `PAPERCLIP_DEV_RUNNER_LOG_DIR=/path/to/logs` to move these diagnostics, or set `PAPERCLIP_DEV_RUNNER_HEALTH_INTERVAL_MS=0` to disable the background health probe.

Tailscale/private-auth dev mode:

```sh
pnpm dev --tailscale-auth
```

This runs dev as `authenticated/private` and binds the server to `0.0.0.0` for private-network access.

Allow additional private hostnames (for example custom Tailscale hostnames):

```sh
pnpm paperclipai allowed-hostname dotta-macbook-pro
```

## One-Command Local Run

For a first-time local install, you can bootstrap and run in one command:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai run
```

`paperclipai run` does:

1. auto-onboard if config is missing
2. `paperclipai doctor` with repair enabled
3. starts the server when checks pass

## Docker Quickstart (No local Node install)

Build and run papercompany in Docker:

```sh
docker build -t paperclip-local .
docker run --name paperclip \
  -p 3200:3200 \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e PAPERCLIP_HOME=/paperclip \
  -v "$(pwd)/data/docker-paperclip:/paperclip" \
  paperclip-local
```

Or use Compose:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.quickstart.yml up --build
```

See `doc/DOCKER.md` for API key wiring (`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and persistence details.

## Docker For Untrusted PR Review

For a separate review-oriented container that keeps `codex`/`claude` login state in Docker volumes and checks out PRs into an isolated scratch workspace, see `doc/UNTRUSTED-PR-REVIEW.md`.

## Database in Dev (Auto-Handled)

For local development, leave `DATABASE_URL` unset.
The server will automatically use embedded PostgreSQL and persist data at:

- `~/.paperclip/instances/default/db`

Override home and instance:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_HOME=/custom/path PAPERCLIP_INSTANCE_ID=dev pnpm paperclipai run
```

No Docker or external database is required for this mode.

## Storage in Dev (Auto-Handled)

For local development, the default storage provider is `local_disk`, which persists uploaded images/attachments at:

- `~/.paperclip/instances/default/data/storage`

Configure storage provider/settings:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai configure --section storage
```

## Default Agent Workspaces

When a local agent run has no resolved project/session workspace, papercompany falls back to an agent home workspace under the instance root:

- `~/.paperclip/instances/default/workspaces/<agent-id>`

This path honors `PAPERCLIP_HOME` and `PAPERCLIP_INSTANCE_ID` in non-default setups.

For `codex_local`, papercompany also manages a per-company Codex home under the instance root and seeds it from the shared Codex login/config home (`$CODEX_HOME` or `~/.codex`):

- `~/.paperclip/instances/default/companies/<company-id>/codex-home`

## Worktree-local Instances

When developing from multiple git worktrees, do not point two papercompany servers at the same embedded PostgreSQL data directory.

Instead, create a repo-local papercompany config plus an isolated instance for the worktree:

```sh
paperclipai worktree init
# or create the git worktree and initialize it in one step:
pnpm paperclipai worktree:make paperclip-pr-432
```

This command:

- writes repo-local files at `.paperclip/config.json` and `.paperclip/.env`
- creates an isolated instance under `~/.paperclip-worktrees/instances/<worktree-id>/`
- when run inside a linked git worktree, mirrors the effective git hooks into that worktree's private git dir
- picks a free app port and embedded PostgreSQL port
- by default seeds the isolated DB in `minimal` mode from the current effective papercompany instance/config (repo-local worktree config when present, otherwise the default instance) via a logical SQL snapshot

Seed modes:

- `minimal` keeps core app state like companies, projects, issues, comments, approvals, and auth state, preserves schema for all tables, but omits row data from heavy operational history such as heartbeat runs, wake requests, activity logs, runtime services, and agent session state
- `full` makes a full logical clone of the source instance
- `--no-seed` creates an empty isolated instance

After `worktree init`, both the server and the CLI auto-load the repo-local `.paperclip/.env` when run inside that worktree, so normal commands like `pnpm dev`, `paperclipai doctor`, and `paperclipai db:backup` stay scoped to the worktree instance.

That repo-local env also sets:

- `PAPERCLIP_IN_WORKTREE=true`
- `PAPERCLIP_WORKTREE_NAME=<worktree-name>`
- `PAPERCLIP_WORKTREE_COLOR=<hex-color>`

The server/UI use those values for worktree-specific branding such as the top banner and dynamically colored favicon.

Print shell exports explicitly when needed:

```sh
paperclipai worktree env
# or:
eval "$(paperclipai worktree env)"
```

### Worktree CLI Reference

**`pnpm paperclipai worktree init [options]`** — Create repo-local config/env and an isolated instance for the current worktree.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--name <name>` | Display name used to derive the instance id |
| `--instance <id>` | Explicit isolated instance id |
| `--home <path>` | Home root for worktree instances (default: `~/.paperclip-worktrees`) |
| `--from-config <path>` | Source config.json to seed from |
| `--from-data-dir <path>` | Source PAPERCLIP_HOME used when deriving the source config |
| `--from-instance <id>` | Source instance id (default: `default`) |
| `--server-port <port>` | Preferred server port |
| `--db-port <port>` | Preferred embedded Postgres port |
| `--seed-mode <mode>` | Seed profile: `minimal` or `full` (default: `minimal`) |
| `--no-seed` | Skip database seeding from the source instance |
| `--force` | Replace existing repo-local config and isolated instance data |

Examples:

```sh
paperclipai worktree init --no-seed
paperclipai worktree init --seed-mode full
paperclipai worktree init --from-instance default
paperclipai worktree init --from-data-dir ~/.paperclip
paperclipai worktree init --force
```

**`pnpm paperclipai worktree:make <name> [options]`** — Create `~/NAME` as a git worktree, then initialize an isolated papercompany instance inside it. This combines `git worktree add` with `worktree init` in a single step.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--start-point <ref>` | Remote ref to base the new branch on (e.g. `origin/main`) |
| `--instance <id>` | Explicit isolated instance id |
| `--home <path>` | Home root for worktree instances (default: `~/.paperclip-worktrees`) |
| `--from-config <path>` | Source config.json to seed from |
| `--from-data-dir <path>` | Source PAPERCLIP_HOME used when deriving the source config |
| `--from-instance <id>` | Source instance id (default: `default`) |
| `--server-port <port>` | Preferred server port |
| `--db-port <port>` | Preferred embedded Postgres port |
| `--seed-mode <mode>` | Seed profile: `minimal` or `full` (default: `minimal`) |
| `--no-seed` | Skip database seeding from the source instance |
| `--force` | Replace existing repo-local config and isolated instance data |

Examples:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai worktree:make paperclip-pr-432
pnpm paperclipai worktree:make my-feature --start-point origin/main
pnpm paperclipai worktree:make experiment --no-seed
```

**`pnpm paperclipai worktree env [options]`** — Print shell exports for the current worktree-local papercompany instance.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-c, --config <path>` | Path to config file |
| `--json` | Print JSON instead of shell exports |

Examples:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai worktree env
pnpm paperclipai worktree env --json
eval "$(pnpm paperclipai worktree env)"
```

For project execution worktrees, papercompany can also run a project-defined provision command after it creates or reuses an isolated git worktree. Configure this on the project's execution workspace policy (`workspaceStrategy.provisionCommand`). The command runs inside the derived worktree and receives `PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_*`, `PAPERCLIP_PROJECT_ID`, `PAPERCLIP_AGENT_ID`, and `PAPERCLIP_ISSUE_*` environment variables so each repo can bootstrap itself however it wants.

## Quick Health Checks

In another terminal:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3200/api/health
curl http://localhost:3200/api/companies
```

Expected:

- `/api/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- `/api/companies` returns a JSON array

## Reset Local Dev Database

To wipe local dev data and start fresh:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.paperclip/instances/default/db
pnpm dev
```

## Optional: Use External Postgres

If you set `DATABASE_URL`, the server will use that instead of embedded PostgreSQL.

## Automatic DB Backups

papercompany can run automatic DB backups on a timer. Defaults:

- enabled
- every 60 minutes
- retain 30 days
- backup dir: `~/.paperclip/instances/default/data/backups`

Configure these in:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai configure --section database
```

Run a one-off backup manually:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai db:backup
# or:
pnpm db:backup
```

Environment overrides:

- `PAPERCLIP_DB_BACKUP_ENABLED=true|false`
- `PAPERCLIP_DB_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES=<minutes>`
- `PAPERCLIP_DB_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=<days>`
- `PAPERCLIP_DB_BACKUP_DIR=/absolute/or/~/path`

## Secrets in Dev

Agent env vars now support secret references. By default, secret values are stored with local encryption and only secret refs are persisted in agent config.

- Default local key path: `~/.paperclip/instances/default/secrets/master.key`
- Override key material directly: `PAPERCLIP_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY`
- Override key file path: `PAPERCLIP_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY_FILE`

Strict mode (recommended outside local trusted machines):

```sh
PAPERCLIP_SECRETS_STRICT_MODE=true
```

When strict mode is enabled, sensitive env keys (for example `*_API_KEY`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`) must use secret references instead of inline plain values.

CLI configuration support:

- `pnpm paperclipai onboard` writes a default `secrets` config section (`local_encrypted`, strict mode off, key file path set) and creates a local key file when needed.
- `pnpm paperclipai configure --section secrets` lets you update provider/strict mode/key path and creates the local key file when needed.
- `pnpm paperclipai doctor` validates secrets adapter configuration and can create a missing local key file with `--repair`.

Migration helper for existing inline env secrets:

```sh
pnpm secrets:migrate-inline-env         # dry run
pnpm secrets:migrate-inline-env --apply # apply migration
```

## Company Deletion Toggle

Company deletion is intended as a dev/debug capability and can be disabled at runtime:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_ENABLE_COMPANY_DELETION=false
```

Default behavior:

- `local_trusted`: enabled
- `authenticated`: disabled

## CLI Client Operations

The papercompany CLI surface, currently exposed through `paperclipai`, includes client-side control-plane commands in addition to setup commands.

Quick examples:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai issue list --company-id <company-id>
pnpm paperclipai issue create --company-id <company-id> --title "Investigate checkout conflict"
pnpm paperclipai issue update <issue-id> --status in_progress --comment "Started triage"
```

Set defaults once with context profiles:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai context set --api-base http://localhost:3200 --company-id <company-id>
```

Then run commands without repeating flags:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai issue list
pnpm paperclipai dashboard get
```

See full command reference in `doc/CLI.md`.

## OpenClaw Invite Onboarding Endpoints

Agent-oriented invite onboarding now exposes machine-readable API docs:

- `GET /api/invites/:token` returns invite summary plus onboarding and skills index links.
- `GET /api/invites/:token/onboarding` returns onboarding manifest details (registration endpoint, claim endpoint template, skill install hints).
- `GET /api/invites/:token/onboarding.txt` returns a plain-text onboarding doc intended for both human operators and agents (llm.txt-style handoff), including optional inviter message and suggested network host candidates.
- `GET /api/skills/index` lists available skill documents.
- `GET /api/skills/paperclip` returns the Paperclip-compatible heartbeat skill markdown.

## OpenClaw Join Smoke Test

Run the end-to-end OpenClaw join smoke harness:

```sh
pnpm smoke:openclaw-join
```

What it validates:

- invite creation for agent-only join
- agent join request using `adapterType=openclaw`
- board approval + one-time API key claim semantics
- callback delivery on wakeup to a dockerized OpenClaw-style webhook receiver

Required permissions:

- This script performs board-governed actions (create invite, approve join, wakeup another agent).
- In authenticated mode, run with board auth via `PAPERCLIP_AUTH_HEADER` or `PAPERCLIP_COOKIE`.

Optional auth flags (for authenticated mode):

- `PAPERCLIP_AUTH_HEADER` (for example `Bearer ...`)
- `PAPERCLIP_COOKIE` (session cookie header value)

## OpenClaw Docker UI One-Command Script

To boot OpenClaw in Docker and print a host-browser dashboard URL in one command:

```sh
pnpm smoke:openclaw-docker-ui
```

This script lives at `scripts/smoke/openclaw-docker-ui.sh` and automates clone/build/config/start for Compose-based local OpenClaw UI testing.

Pairing behavior for this smoke script:

- default `OPENCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH=1` (no Control UI pairing prompt for local smoke; no extra pairing env vars required)
- set `OPENCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH=0` to require standard device pairing

Model behavior for this smoke script:

- defaults to OpenAI models (`openai/gpt-5.2` + OpenAI fallback) so it does not require Anthropic auth by default

State behavior for this smoke script:

- defaults to isolated config dir `~/.openclaw-paperclip-smoke`
- resets smoke agent state each run by default (`OPENCLAW_RESET_STATE=1`) to avoid stale provider/auth drift

Networking behavior for this smoke script:

- auto-detects and prints a papercompany host URL reachable from inside OpenClaw Docker
- default container-side host alias is `host.docker.internal` (override with `PAPERCLIP_HOST_FROM_CONTAINER` / `PAPERCLIP_HOST_PORT`)
- if papercompany rejects container hostnames in authenticated/private mode, allow `host.docker.internal` via `pnpm paperclipai allowed-hostname host.docker.internal` and restart papercompany
